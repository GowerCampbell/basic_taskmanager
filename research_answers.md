1. HTTP State Management
HTTP is inherently stateless, meaning each request-response cycle is independent. To preserve state across multiple cycles, web applications use mechanisms like cookies, sessions, and tokens. For user authentication and session management, Django employs a session framework that stores session data server-side and sends a session ID to the client via a cookie. When a user logs in, Django creates a session, associates it with the user, and stores it in the database (or cache). Subsequent requests include the session ID, allowing the server to retrieve the user's state (e.g., authentication status). This ensures continuity, such as maintaining a logged-in state, across stateless HTTP requests.

2. Django Migrations to MariaDB
To perform Django database migrations to a server-based relational database like MariaDB, first install the MariaDB server and a Python connector like `mysqlclient`. Configure Django's `settings.py` by updating the `DATABASES` setting with `'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql'`, and provide credentials (e.g., `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`). Locally, run `python manage.py makemigrations` to generate migration files based on model changes, then `python manage.py migrate` to apply them to MariaDB. On a production server, transfer the project, install dependencies, and run the same `migrate` command. Ensure the database schema exists on MariaDB beforehand (e.g., via `CREATE DATABASE sticky_notes;`), and use environment variables for secure credential management.
